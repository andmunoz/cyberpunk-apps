# Cyberpunk Apps

In this repository you can found personal projects about Cyberpunk 2020 Role Playing Game, including:

- **cpdatabase**: a legacy project created in php to administrate a local database. It was a good project, but too difficult to manitain.
- **CPHP-Project**: a legacy project a front-end site (only HTML and JQuery) to navigate a database. Database is published in Firebase but is not working (I've change the model).
- **cybertools**: my new personal project (instead CPHP-Project) that use more efficient tecnology. Is made with Django and use local data with SQLite and remote data in Firebase.
- **tiny_site**: is the public front-end site (published in https://cyberpunk2020.tiiny.site/) to consume data in Firebase created by cybertools project.
